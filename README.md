# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
The goal of this project was to create an interactive dashboard for HR managers and business leaders to make data-driven decisions. It aimed to optimize workforce planning, improve retention, enhance productivity, analyze attrition factors, monitor diversity efforts, and ensure equitable salary distribution. The project followed a structured process like gathering requirements, preparing and cleaning HR data, designing an interactive dashboard using Power BI, developing and testing metrics, and deploying it with iterative improvements. The dashboard provides workforce stats, attrition trends, performance metrics, salary distribution, diversity insights, and attendance tracking. Interactive filters enabled by gender and marital status, offering actionable insights to optimize retention, productivity, and equity while supporting informed HR decision-making across all key aspects of employee management.
